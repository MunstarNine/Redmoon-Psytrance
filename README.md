# Redmoon-Psytrance
This game is my first Java project ever so I decided to use it as portfolio

Dear people:

To run this game you NEED to download the lastest version of Processing and inside of it you need the Minim library. There's a option to export this game in a .exe but I want to give the bare code of it.

When I was creating this game I didn't know about Git or Github, so I uploaded the lastest version I did.

If you want to download the full game, download the .rar file called "Redmoon - Pystrance"

I'll apreciate any review that you want to make! â™¥
